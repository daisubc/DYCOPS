# Reflections
<img src="/assets/images/blog/awards/sf.jpg" width="100%" alt="san francisco">
2016 has been a very exciting year for the Chem-E-Car team. We have presented our work in more than 7 conferences, with topics ranging from the clean energy industry (Generate 2016) to chemical engineering innovation (CHBE Engineering Research Day). From these events, we have won 5 different awards. Notably, we placed 1st among 41 teams from all over the world for our poster presentation at the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) 2016 Student Conference in San Francisco.

In addition to our successes in these events, the team has also progressed and grown immensely. From a small group of 5 students just two years ago, the team has developed to a 40+ member organization. Aside from our Chem-E-Car activities, we have also started working on two more projects including a rechargeable microgrid system, and an integrated hardware/software beer brewing app for the AIChE National App Competition. To accommodate increasing student interests in our projects, we have streamlined our organizational structure and established a very dedicated and passionate junior Chem-E-Car team. We intend to send two cars to compete in the 2017 Pacific Northwest Regionals Chem-E-Car Competition.

Our equipment has also been upgraded thanks to an extremely generous donation from our Exclusive Diamond Sponsor, the Daniel Family Foundation. We would also like to thank: Precision NanoSystems, BotFeeder, MG Chemicals, Digital Ocean, FortisBC, and CHBE for all of their support.

The 2016-2017 period promises to be extremely exciting for Chem-E-Car as we have been invited to compete as the representatives of Canada at the
10th Annual World Chemical Engineering Congress to be held in Barcelona.
