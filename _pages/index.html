				<h3>Dimensionality Reduction</h3>
				<p>Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of variables in a set of data to isolate a certain variables. There are many applications of this to process control, since it would be useful to find lower-dimensional representations of a dataset without losing much of the data.</p>
