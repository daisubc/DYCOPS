      <p class="post-entry" style="vertical-align: center">Sirish L. Shah has been with the University of ALberta since 1978, where he held the NSERC-MatrikonSuncor-iCORE Senior Industrial Research Chair in Computer Process Control from 2000 to 2012. He is the recipient of the Albright &amp; Wilson Americas Award of the Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering (CSChE) in 1989, the Killam Professor in 2003, the D.G. Fisher Award of the CSChE for significant contributions in the field of systems and control, the ASTECH award in 2011 and the 2015-IEEE Transition to Practice award. He has held visiting appointments at Oxford University and Balliol College as a SERC fellow, Kumamoto University (Japan) as a senior research fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), the University of Newcastle, Australia,      IIT-Madras India and the National University of Singapore. The main areas of his current
      research are process and performance monitoring, analysis and rationalization of alarm systems. He has co-authored three books, the first titled, Performance Assessment of Control Loops: Theory and Applications, a second titled ‘Diagnosis of Process Nonlinearities and Valve Stiction: Data Driven Approaches”, and a more recent monograph on “Capturing connectivity and causality in complex industrial processes”. He is Emeritus Professor at the University of Alberta, a fellow of the Canadian Academy of Engineering and the Chemical Institute of Canada.</p>

    <div class="container-fluid col-sm-9">
      <p class="post-entry" style="vertical-align: center">Dr. Gopaluni's primary research interests are in Process Modeling and Control. He is interested in developing and studying the properties of data-based models for a variety of chemical and biological systems. These systems are typically nonlinear, hybrid and time varying, and their measurements are often noisy and irregular. The thrust of his research is on developing high quality models for such processes and adapting them to reflect process changes. His research interests also span a wide range of other areas including identification for control, model predictive controllers, adaptive control, and performance monitoring and assessment.

His interests are process control and statistical modeelling of time-series data. His current PhD research focuses on the application of Machine Learning techniques to design smart controllers, which identify and predict process faults ahead of time and apply appropriate control actions to prevent such faults.</p>
